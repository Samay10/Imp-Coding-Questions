So, we have to choose two numbers from the array, such that their sum is equal to target.

Here, we will us the brute force method.

1) First, initialize the outer loop from i=0 to i<n.
2) Then create an inner loop and initialize it from j=i+1 to j<n;
3) If nums[i] + nums[j] = target, then we will return {i, j} else if not equal, then we will return {-1, -1}.
